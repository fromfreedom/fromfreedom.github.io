title: Comrades and Jasic workers in my eyes - Commemorating the 7.27 arrest for six mouths
categories: ['english']
---
<p>今天是2019年1月27日，距离7.27大抓捕已过去整整六个月了。2018年7月27日，广东警方暴力抓捕了29名建会及声援工人。至今，已有近五十名觉悟工人和进步学子身陷囹圄。半年过去了，佳士工人声援团与黑恶势力的斗争从未停息，仍在继续。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today is January 27, 2019, and it has been six months since the 7.27 arrest. On July 27, 2018, the Guangdong police violently arrested 29 members of the association and solidarity workers. So far, nearly 50 enlightened workers and progressive students have been trapped. Half a year later, the struggle between the Jasic Workers' Support Group and the evil forces has never stopped.</p>

<p>我是一名参加过声援团的学生。六个月来，除了在争取同志们的自由，我还常常回想起他们身上的优秀品质。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a student who has participated in the support group. In the past six months, in addition to fighting for the freedom of comrades, I often recall the excellent qualities of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>还记得我看过浚聪和兰凤写的文章，知道了他当时为什么要反抗强制徒步：“打工者的真正出路只有一条，不再冷漠，不再沉默，不再自私自利，不再事不关己高高挂起，因为工人作为弱势群体，只有努力发声，只有团结反抗，只有团结的像一个人，才能让我们的生活，让我们的未来，让我们的亲人孩子有一个幸福美好的未来！”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I still remember I have read the articles written by Yu Juncong and Huang lanfeng, knowing why he had to resist forced walking at the time: "The only way for the workers is to be no longer indifferent, no longer silent, and no longer selfish. It can not be disregard, because workers are a vulnerable group, only to work hard, only unite and rebel, only united like a person, can make our lives, future, and loved ones have a happy and beautiful future!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>我第一次体会到，为什么说马列毛主义是工人阶级的学说；第一次在现实中感受到，掌握了马列毛思想的工人将是多么的无私无畏。“不再自私自利，团结得像一个人”，浚聪做到了，他为工人兄弟姐妹们的权益，奉献了自己的自由。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the first time I have appreciated, why the Marxism-Leninism-Maoism is the workers' doctrine. For the first time I have experienced, how brave and how fearless the workers armed with Marxism-Leninism-Maoism are. "No more selfish and egoistic, and to stand together as one." Juncong has fulfilled his words. He pledged his freedom for the right of his worker brothers and sisters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>我和展振振同学认识一年多了，他也是声援团的一员，是我并肩战斗的同志。我第一次为他感动落泪，是他在韶山纪念毛诞时从心里吼出来的话：“中国有2.8亿农民工，6000万留守儿童，600万尘肺病人，他们哪一个不是和我的母亲一样？”而他却因为纪念毛主席被捕和被退学。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have met Zhan Zhenzhen for more than 1 year. He is also a member of the Support Group and my comrade in arm. For the first time he touched me to cry, when he, celebrating the anniversary of Mao's birthday in Shaoshan, shouted the words from the bottom of his heart: "There are 280 millions migrant workers, 60 millions left-behind children, 6 millions people with pneumoconiosis in China. Who of them aren't the same as my mother?" But he was arrested and expelled from Peking University only for the celebration of Mao's birthday.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>做调研报告的时候，他“曾经连续几天只能睡三四个小时，那么大的个头也会偶尔累趴在教室的桌子上呼呼大睡。”现在他与四位佳士工友、志伟、兰凤一起被捕了，并且被北大退学。但他有过后悔吗？如果有，怎么又能讲得出那句“镇压吧，镇压吧，镇压个十年八年，人民就都觉醒了。工人阶级连死都不怕，还怕镇压吗？”就像张子尉同学讲的：“拘捕退学又如何？定叫红旗卷遍！”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When he investigating, he "used to sleep for three or four hours for several days, such a tall man would  occasionally be tired and fall asleep on the desk in the classroom." Now he was arrested with four Jasic workers, Zhiwei and Lanfeng, and dropped out of Peking University. But was he ever regret? If so, how can he say "Repression! Let them repress for ten more years, then the people will awake. The workers are not afraid of death. How could they afraid of repression?" As Zhang Ziwei said, "The arrest and the dropout don't make me fright, the Red Flag will wave everywhere!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>还有宁丁老同志的事迹同样让人感动。宁丁同志是一名退伍老兵，十几年来坚持带领退伍军人和工人维护合法权益。在听说了佳士工友和声援团的斗争后，宁丁同志不顾疾病，主动来到声援团现场，支持工学结合的斗争。据宁丁同志说，他当时是抱着要死在那里的决心的去声援团的，想和一线的tz一起被清场。8.23清场风声放出后，宁丁同志坚持要留守，带动很多老同志也留了下来。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our old comrade Ning Ding is also touching. Comrade Ning Ding is a veteran who has insisted on leading veterans and workers to defend their legitimate rights and interests for more than a decade. After learning about the struggle of the Jasic workers and the support group, comrade Ning Ding took the initiative to come to support the struggle of the workers and students. According to himself, he went to the support group with the determination to die there and wanted to be site-cleared with the front-line comrades. After the intelligence of the site-clearing was released in 23 Aug, comrade Ning Ding insisted on staying and drove many old comrades to stay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>他们是真正地把自己奉献给了工人阶级解放的事业，不求半点私利。他们的斗争精神和奉献精神，将使越来越多不愿忍受压迫的人们团结到声援团的旗帜之下，为了劳动者的权益去斗争。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They truly dedicated themself to the cause of the liberation of the working class, not for the slightest self-interest. Their fighting spirit and dedication will enable more and more people who do not want to endure oppression to unite under the banner of the support group and fight for the rights of workers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>距离2019年的农历新年还有一周，我们是多么希望狱中的工友和同志们能无罪释放、回家过春节啊！但历史和现实都证明，只有不屈的斗争，才能使正义得以彰显，才能使无产阶级得到真正的自由和解放。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>With one week to go until the Spring Festival in 2019, how we hope that our coworkers and comrades who are in prisonand  will be released without charge and go home for the Spring Festival! However, both history and reality have proved that only through unyielding struggle can justice be revealed and the proletariat be truly free and liberated.</p>
