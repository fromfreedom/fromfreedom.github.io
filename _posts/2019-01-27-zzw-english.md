<p>我是张子尉，北京大学2017级本科生，今天，我正被限制着人身和通讯自由，怀着冤屈和不解写出这段话。 </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m Zhang Ziwei, a student of Class 2017 in Peking University. Now, under the restraint of personal and communication freedom, I’m writing the following words with puzzling. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>我受到的不公待遇来自于去年12月28日，我曾在北大校园里举牌抗议强行改组北大马会，要求恢复工友之家。那一天，我和其他十几名同学每人被五六名老师抬进教室，限制人身自由长达16(实为18)个小时，期间我的父母还被叫来与我对质，受迫下对我边打边哭。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The injustice that I’m undertaking is the result of my participation in the struggle against the PKU administration's forced reorganization of the Marxism Society and the closure of Worker’s Home on December 28th, 2018. But several students and me were dragged into a classroom and detained for 18 hours. Meanwhile, my parents were forced to confront and beat me with tears.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>从那以后，我便成了警察的常客。一次我从宿舍厕所出来，立刻被保卫处的人员扭送到楼长室接受警察谈话，而我当时正在复习3个小时后的英语考试。另两次更让我难堪：我从考场离开时，立刻有老师围上，不允许我得自由，将我推进警察所在的教室“聊天”；有一个警察甚至还在我考试时站到了我的桌旁踮脚。而这些谈话的内容却十分可笑，什么“要尊重学习机会”，“好好考试”，就像打扰我的不是他们一样。我不得不在通宵学习和考试之后仍去迎接。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been frequently harassed by the cops since that day. One day, when I was walking out of the toilet in my dormitory, I was forcedly pulled into the housemaster’s office to be questioned by some police officers. Several days later, when I was taking my final exam of this term, a cop stood beside and monitored me. After the exam, I was pushed into another classroom to "have a talk" with the cops. They hypocritically advised me that I should "take care of my learning chance" and "concentrate on the exams" as if it were not them that wandering around me when I was taking my exams! And I have to "greet" them after whole days of studying and testing.</p>

<p>北京大学15级生命科学学院的学长展振振竟已遭拘捕并被退学了，谁忘得了他去年在发起工友生活调研和保卫高校马克思主义社团时付出的努力呢？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zhan Zhenzhen, a senior of the School of Life Science, Peking University has been apparently arrested and expelled from the school. Who can forget his efforts during the last year in launching a research project on the lives of his fellow workers and defending the university's Marxist Society?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>打压在寒假开始之后达到了高潮。1月16日，一名女生考完后，立即被家长和老师围堵，要把她绑回家去。她不愿意，高声叫喊，但是有二三十名老师驱散围观学生。我不愿她被抬进出租车，上前阻拦，但是我被按倒在地，压着脑袋。最终，在学校的鼎力相助（甚至是威逼利诱）之下，她的亲属才得以将她抬上车带走。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The crackdown reached a climax after the start of winter break. On January 16, a girl was immediately mobbed by parents and teachers who tried to kidnap her and take her home. She did not want to, shouting, but there are 20 or 30 teachers to disperse the crowd of students. I didn't want her to get into a cab and get in the way, but I was on the ground, head down. In the end, with the "assistance"(or coercion) from the school, her relatives were managed to carry her into the car.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>与其他几名同学匆匆离开学校，赶到天津，以期保护自己，可是不到一周时间，我们便纷纷被找到。1月21日下午，先有四名同志失联，我们感到了迫在眉头的危机——就在天津，黑恶势力都对我们下手了。发现危险后，两名同志立刻准备转移，可他们才离开没几分钟，便传出了“报警”的喊声！从窗户望出去，就可看到他们被几人抬着，塞进楼下停着的一辆SUV轿车中了。没多久，我就听到了楼道里挨家挨户的敲门声。自知难逃一劫的我，立刻录下视频，说明了情况，等待着被带走的一刻。</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I left school with a few other students in a hurry to Tianjin to protect ourselves, but within a week, we were found. In the afternoon of January 21st, four of my comrades went missing, and we felt an imminent crisis -- even in Tianjin, they were still all over us. After discovering the danger, two comrades immediately prepare to evacuate, but only a few minutes after their left, their crying broke: "Help, help!" Looking out the window, they could be seen being carried by several men and bundled into an SUV parked downstairs. It wasn't long before the sound of knocks - door by door - echoed in the hallway. Knowing that I was certain to be arrested, I immediately recorded a video, explained the situation, and then waited to be taken away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>很快，我便被押到了北辰分局，在这里等待了将近四个小时之后，匆匆做了两次笔录，到办案区走了一遭，然后我被移交给家乡的国保，在派出所旁的宾馆限制起来。现实给了我一记重拳：今天下午老师和国保一来到宾馆，一见面便立刻问我在天津做了什么、认识哪些人、计划是什么。而我稍一回答不如其意，便遭质问，说什么：“思想一点都没变”“你过年肯定不好过，那我过年也好过不了，那你过年就更难过了！”事后警察对我父亲也说过“谁知道他们聚在一起又会闹出些什么名堂，还是控制起来安稳。”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Soon after I was taken to the Beichen Police station. After waiting for nearly four hours, I hurriedly made two transcripts and went to the case-handling area. Then I was handed over to the interior security police(=political police) of my hometown, and detained in a hotel next to the police station. In the afternoon of January 25, when a teacher and the political police came to the hotel, they interrogated me what I had done in Tianjin, the people I contacted, and what the plan I had. When I didn't obey their arrangement, I was rebuked: "You have never changed your  ideas",  "You will have a terrible Spring Festival, therefore so do I, and then yours will be worse". After the interrogation, the police said to my father, "Who knows what will happen if they get together again, so it's better to 'contain' them, for safety."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>有些人在被带到派出所后，拒不认错，拒不愿回到家中受到限制。为此，丧尽天良的黑警们竟将他们纷纷投入了监牢，给予了拘留！我实在无法想象，那些同志们将经受的考验。同在北大读本科的马世泽同学也受到了刑事拘留，并“没戏(回去上学)了”！</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some students refused to admit their "faults" after being taken to the police station and refused to go back home for soft custody. The evil police authority than simply put them into prison and gave them detention! I really can't imagine the trials that those people will endure. Ma Shize, also an undergraduate at Peking University, was detained in criminal detention, and got "busted"(from continuing his career)!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>但是我们相信无论在广阔的天地，在家中，还是在牢房，只要心中念着无产阶级，念着受苦受累又受尽压迫剥削的劳动者们，战斗的热情就不会消弭。即使我们不在了，我们也已经看到，有这么多同志加入到斗争的行列中来了。又有什么可叹息的呢？</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But we believe that no matter in the vast world, at home, or in a prison cell, as long as our minds are with the proletariat and the laborers, who are now suffering and under oppressive exploitation, our morale for fighting will not vanish away. Even if we are gone, we have already seen that so many comrades joined the ranks of our struggle. So why do I sigh?</p>
