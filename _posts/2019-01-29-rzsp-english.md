<p>顾佳悦：同时在这个过程中，它有几点比较恶劣，一个就是卷入了很多普通的热心群众和学生，卷入了这件事情。然后另一个就是这种倒逼政府和资方进行让步的维权模式，如果一经模仿或者一经推广的话，其实对我国的一个安宁稳定也是有很恶劣的影响的。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gu Jiayue: And there are something bad during the incident. One is the involvement of many passionate masses and students. The other one is, if such mode of defending rights by forcing the government and the employers to compromise goes widespreaded, it will make a very bad impact on China's peace and stability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>在接触左翼理论之前，我比较多愁善感，对于社会的阴暗面比较悲伤憎恨，又对自己的优越生活呢，也有一定的内疚感。上了大学，我的专业是医学，经常听到像看病贵看病难这样的一些悲惨故事，对社会的黑暗和不公更加的憎恨，同时也找不到出路。在这样的一个背景下，我加入了北京大学马克思主义学会学习激进的左派理论，在学习中我们援引的案例都十分极端，比如说像国企工人下岗，无依无靠，冻饿致死；或者是珠三角的工人们受尽盘剥。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Before learning about left-wing theory, I'm somehow sentimental. I feel sad and angry for the dark side of the society, and feel guilty for my superior life. When I went to college, I majored in medicine science, I often heard some tragic stories that it's too expensive or difficult for ordinary people to get medical treatment. I was becoming more and more angry about the darkness and the unfairness of the society, while I can't find way out. That's the background of me to join the Marxist Society of Peking University, to learn about the radical left-wing theory. We have studied a lot of extreme cases, such as laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises, helpless, starving to death; or the workers in the Pearl River Delta region have been exploited.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>这样的现状让我感到社会几无光明面，党和政府对这一切不管不顾，我们只能通过先进的工人组织发展工人运动，推翻现政权，才能建立真正的社会主义，达到人人平等的一个社会。我不仅在理论上接受了激进理论，在组织上我也参加相应的组织，社交圈呢就越来越固化，对自己的思想没有反思的机会。但是实质上我对中国的国情是并不了解的，比如说现在党和政府到底采取了哪些具体措施，是去消弥不平等，等等，我全都没有思考。在大学期间，我在社团中宣扬左翼激进理论，将社团发展壮大，虽然没有直接参与工人运动，但是结识了一些激进工人运动的团体，其中就有这次佳士事件的主要策划者。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All of that make me think the Chinese society is full of darkness and hopeless, and the Party and the Government don't care at all. The only way to the real socialist world, in which everyone is equal, is to organize advanced workers to build workers' movement and overthrow the regime. I'm not only accepted the radical theory in mind, but also took part in the related organizations. My circle of friends was becoming more and more solidified, which make me have no chance to rethink my thoughts. In fact, I didn't know Chinese society very well, such as what measures the Party and the government have taken to eliminate inequality. I have not thought about it at all. In the university, it's me to advocate radical left-wing theory, to develop the society. Although I was not participated in the workers' movement directly, I met some of the radical workers' movement organizations, including the major planner of the Jasic incident.</p>

<p>毕业之后我创立了时代先锋网，名义上是关注弱势群体，关注像工人农民这样的群体，并且反映他们的一个生存状况。但实际上的目的并不是全面客观地反映他们的生存状况和所思所想，而是主要聚焦在他们的所谓抗争行动，尤其是对于资方和政府的一些对抗行动上面。在事实层面的话，时代先锋其实对于它所报道的那些所谓抗争行为也并不是十分清楚，大多数时候是转引自其他网站，或者是剪辑拼凑而成的。比如说像塔吊事件，对于个种细节，其实时代先锋网自己也是并不清楚的。对于佳士事件也是同样的道理，只转载当时工人自己的文章，或者是一些激进左派的言论。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>After the graduation, I founded the website Pioneers of Time, which is nominally concerned about vulnerable groups, such as workers and peasants, and report their conditions of living. But which, and whose thought, is not the primary coverage of reports. The primary coverage is focus on their so-called resistance actions, especially against the employers and the government. In the matter of fact, Pioneers of Time is not very clear about the events it reports, most of them are references from other websites, or made up by editing and clipping. For example, about the tower crane workers' strike, the Pioneers of Time was not clear about the detail of the event, same as the Jasic incident. We are doing nothing but reposting text information from the workers, or some radical leftist comments.</p>

<p>郑永明：我们社团里边写的关于新中国建国60年后的历史，那么这个历史它主要的内容就是跟我们讲，跟我们讲改革开放前30年才是真正的社会主义，而文化大革命并不是我们之前教科书讲的一样，它是讲它是为了反对官僚主义的一场群众运动。然后改革开放，正是因为文化大革命它失败了，所以的话整个官僚资本主义复辟的一个道路。然后通过这个历史材料，他给我们展示了他们搜集了很多例子，向我们展示，这个改革开放前30年，它的社会是多么公平多么美好；然后改革开放后30年，他对很多问题进行渲染，然后这样的话就使我们形成了错误的历史观嘛。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Zheng Yongming:  We talked in our society about the 60-years history after the founding of the People's Republic of China, whose main contents are to show that the first 30 years before the Reform and Opening are the real socialist era, while the Cultural Revolution was not so as stated in our school textbook (Note: "An enormous error initiated by Mao"), but a mass movement against bureaucracy as they said. And the Reform and Opening was actually a process of the restoration of bureaucratic capitalism because that the Cultural Revolution failed. Then with such historic materials, he demonstrated us many examples they collected to prove how fair and how beautiful the chinese society of the first 30 years, before the Reform and Opening up was, and then he exaggerated many problems of the latest 30 years after the Reform and Opening up, which brought us a wrong view of history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>顾：在线上，我通过时代先锋发布大量的资讯，引起了广泛的一个舆论效应，造成了线上的一种不满情绪的蔓延；在线下呢，我劝说大学左派社团的大学生，还有一些左派老同志赶赴现场，造成了线下群众的聚集。总之这种方式其实并无益于当时工人的一个权利的维护，而且也超越了法律的途径，给当地的公安机关带来了比较大的执法压力，同时也将一些大学生和不明真相的人民群众引向了违法犯罪的道路。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gu: I have released a lot of information online through the website Pioneers of Time, which motivated the public opinion widely and caused a widespreaded dissatisfaction online. And on the reality I persuaded many university students of the leftist society and some elder leftist comrades to support them on-site, causing the gathering on the scene. In a word, such a way did not helped the workers to defend their rights, furthermore it has exceeded the legal approach, which brought a strong pressure to the local police during the law inforcements. Meanwhile it has also led some college students and the people who are unaware of the truth astray to the road of violating the law and of the crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>郑：我们创建时代先锋网的一个目的，就是希望通过这样一个公开的网站平台，然后通过宣传、炒作社会上的一些负面的敏感事件，然后以达到使社会各个阶层群众对社会对政府的，激起这种不满情绪，然后再借此去传递我们这种激进左翼思想，然后为达到我们的思想的理念去造成这个群众基础。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Zheng: One of our purposes to create the website Pioneers of Time, is such an expectation that we could get a public platform to spread and sensationalise some negative and sensitive events in the society, thus to arise intense discontent among the masses of various classes against the society, against the government,  in order to promote our radical left-wing ideas and enlarge our mass basis for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>旁白：原来他们认为中国现阶段不是社会主义社会，不认可现行政治体制，希望通过学运、工运实现所谓的社会主义。那么经过一段时间的反思，他们的思想和认识又是怎么样的？</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Narrator: They believed that current Chinese society is not the socialist one, and didn’t recognize current political system. They tried to build the so-called socialism by students’ movement and labor movement. After reconsideration, how has their ideas changed?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>顾：我奉行激进理论、缺乏大局意识和法律意识。在佳士事件中采取线上炒作和线下聚集的方式，向资方及当地政府的施压，破坏了当地安宁稳定的局面。而且随着事件的逐渐升级，我发现了很多不明势力的出现，还有很多过激言论令我始料未及。这让我感到心惊胆战，深感自己已经背离了为工人维权的初衷。在公安机关的教育下，我真正地了解了中国国情，尤其了解了十八大以来，为了消除不平等现象，我国党和政府采取的种种具体措施。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Gu: I believed radical theory and was lack of the awareness of overall situation and the law. In Jasic Incident, we tried to suppress the capital and the authority by online media and demonstration, which destabilized the local situation. With the upgrading of the incident, I found that many secret powers and radical words appeared, which surprised me. I was frightened that I might be away from my initiation to defend labor rights. Under the education of the Police, I really understood the true situation of China. Especially, after the PARTY’s 18th Congress, the PARTY and the Authority tried to solve the inequality by various ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>沈梦雨：然而法律并非儿戏，我们的行为已经构成了违法犯罪，不仅严重地扰乱了社会秩序，而且导致一些境外势力利用该事件攻击党和政府，极大地抹黑了中国的国际形象。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Shen Mengyu: However, the law is not a joke. Our activities were actually illegal crimes. They seriously disturb the social order, and ignited the foreign criticism towards the PARTY and the Authority, which dramatically debeautified the image of the Authority</p>
</blockquote>

<p>郑：其实的话，中国改革开放的路线，它是我们党在坚持实事求是的原则，突破了苏联僵化的一个体制，将马克思主义与中国国情实际相结合的一个正确的发展路线。它，就是中国的改革路线，它也没有走僵化的老路，也没有走改旗易帜的邪路。尤其是在十八大以来吧，这几年以来，我们国家所取得的巨大的发展成就，以及人民他的社会生活的幸福感、获得感都是非常高的，这是对改革开放它的正确的一个最好的一个证明。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Zheng: To be frank, the policy of Reform and Opening is the result of the PARTY’s principle of “Seek truth from facts”, and broke with the Soviet system. It is a correct developing line which accorded with both Marxism and Chinese reality. It has neither repeated old words nor got rid of the red flag. Especially, after the PARTY’s 18th Congress, our country made great achievement. People is in great happiness and the feeling of achieving. It powerfully proved the correctness of the Reform and Opening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>岳昕：因为我现在认识到整个自己在佳士事件期间的行为其实触犯了法律，所以也自愿的去接受法律的处罚。同时我也认识到整个佳士事件背后的激进主义的组织和思想，它对于青年学生的危害。所以我也会决心在今后与这样的思想和组织彻底决裂。同时呢，如果有机会的话，也希望能真正去站出来公开地揭露和批判整个思想和组织的行径，以此能给社会各界，尤其是还在高校里的青年学生以警示教育。还有去看新闻联播以及其他的党建读物和政治理论书籍，我更加系统地去了解和认识到我们党到底是一个怎样的制度理念，还有一个全面从严治党的一个制度体系。那么同时呢，我也能够去更加的明白我们党到底是如何根据现实，根据各种各样的情况来发展自己的理论，从而能解决更多的问题。所以我现在更加地明白也更加认识到中国共产党它确实是在新时代能够去更加关注工人和农民的权利，以人民为中心来解决问题，同时呢，也能够在保证社会稳定的基础上促进改革和发展。这样呢，我就能打破很多之前对于中国共产党一些刻板印象，从而更加深刻地认识到，在将来我自己的行动和言论之中，我不仅要和祖国和人民站在一起，也要更加去和党站在一起。</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Yue Xin: Because now I has understood that my activities during the Jasic Incident had violated the law, I will accept the punishment by the law.I also found out the radical organization and ideology behind the Jasic Incident and its harm to young students. So I voluntarily decide to break with the organization and ideology. And if possible, I hope to openly unveil and criticize the ideology as a whole and the organization’s activities, which may warn the mass in our society (especially the young students). I will watch Network News Broadcast (Xin Wen Lian Bo) of CCTV and read the ideological and historical books which are produced by the PARTY. I also will try to clarify the ideals of the PARTY, and study the theory of Ruling PARTY strictly. I hope I can be able to know how our PARTY develop its own ideology according to the reality. So now I understand it is the Communist Party of China that the only one can concern about the rights of workers and peasants in the New Age. And it is the PARTY that can only proceed with reform and development while keeps the social stability. Thus I’ve broken up some mechanical impressions towards the PARTY. I firmly understand that I should stand with firstly the PARTY, not only with the motherland and the people.</p>
