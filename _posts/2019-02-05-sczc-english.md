title: New Year's Pronouncement from the Jasic Workers Support Group --Unite for Greater Victory!
categories: ['english']

Comrades:
>同志们：

As the 2019 Spring Festival approaches, we can not forget the dozens of comrades still in prison, such as the Jasic workers have no news yet,  Fu Changguo, who was not allowed to see his mother for the last time, and the workers and peasants’ children Zhan Zhenzhen was revoked and dropped out of Peking University; we cannot forget that the Spring Festival Gala rendered this flourishing country, and the workers in the workshop endured exploitation. We must not forget the 2018 that marked the unity of the oppressed.

>2019年的农历春节已经到来，在这个本该是阖家团圆的日子里，我们无法忘记至今仍身陷囹圄的数十位同志：建会工友至今杳无音讯，付常国不得见其母最后一面，工农的孩子展振振遭到北大退学。我们无法忘记，工人还在车间受着剥削压迫，台上的晚会却在渲染着这盛世。我们更加无法忘记标志着被压迫者走向团结的2018年。

In this year, the masses’ resistance to the exploiters is also a wave high. The workers, students and the masses united in their struggle because they could not bear the oppression.

>这一年，群众对剥削者的反抗是一浪高过一浪的。工人、学生和各阶层群众因无法忍受压迫，纷纷团结起来斗争。

Truck drivers and crane drivers have gone on strike. We see that the strength of unity is not confined to one region only. The cross-regional industrial workers' union reflects the workers' deep consciousness of consciously fighting for their rights and interests and explain the importance of solidarity.

>卡车司机罢工和塔吊司机罢工让我们看到：团结的力量不仅局限于一个地区，同行业工人跨地区的联合，体现出工人们自觉争取权益的深刻意识，更说明了团结的重要性。

Because of the increasing commonality of contradictions, solidarity has become more widespread. The campaign against sexual assault in more than 70 colleges and universities, as well as veterans from Pingdu defending their rights, is no exception.So, the rights of teachers, the rights of poison vaccines, the rights of financial disasters, the rights of taxi drivers and the rights of pneumoconiosis workers that have broken out all over the country will also be united across provinces and cities. This is the historical trend of the development of the struggle.

>这种团结，因为社会矛盾愈加具有了共性，已经是愈加广泛的体现出来。反性侵斗争中七十余所高校的行动，平度老兵维权中从各地奔赴而来的老兵群体，都是这种团结的体现。那么，各地爆发的教师维权、毒疫苗维权、金融灾难维权、出租车司机维权、尘肺工人维权，也同样会走向跨地区的团结，这是斗争发展的历史趋势。

This year, the struggle of Jasic workers and the Support Groups has continued all the way.

>这一年，佳士工人及其声援团的斗争一路走来，仍在继续。

<br/>

* Between March and July last year, Jasic workers were arrested on July 27th after a violent crackdown by factory and police authority.

>去年3月份至7月份，佳士工友组建自己的工会，被黑厂黑警暴力镇压，于7月27日遭到抓捕。

* In August, the Jasic Workers' Support Group was formed to publicize the deeds of Jasic workers and to support the establishment of the labor union. On August 24, the group was violently evacuated in Huizhou.

>8月份，佳士工人声援团成立，宣传佳士工友事迹，声援工友建会，8月24日在惠州遭到暴力清场。

* In September and October, college bureaucrats blocked the registration of left-wing student society, and the students in the society fought a battle to defend the societies and won a victory in stages.

>9，10月份，各高校官僚阻碍左翼学生社团注册，社团同学开展社团保卫战，取得阶段性胜利。

* On November 9, Guangdong police arrested fellow workers and left-wing youths at Peking University and across the country.

>11月9日，广东警方在北大和全国各地抓捕声援工友、左翼青年。

* On December 26, representatives of the Support Group went to Shaoshan to commemorate the birthday of Chairman Mao. The student who attended the memorial was arrested and expelled from the university.

>12月26日，声援团代表奔赴韶山纪念毛主席诞辰。之后，参与纪念的高校学子遭到抓捕，并被学校开除。

* From December 27 to January 21, the left-wing societies of Peking University, the Renmin University and the Beijing Language and Culture University were forcibly reorganized or cancelled. Students from the Marxism Society of Peking University held signs in protest and were violently evacuated and illegally detained.

>12月27日至1月21日，北大、人大、北语的左翼社团被强制改组或注销，北大马会同学举牌抗议，遭到暴力清场和非法关押。

With the development of the fight, the great significance of the Jasic struggle has become more and more clear in front of us.

>随着斗争的发展，佳士斗争的伟大意义已经愈发清晰地展现在我们眼前。

<br/>

First of all, the young workers emerging in the Jasic struggle were well aware of the situation of the working class - at the bottom of society and under pressure. They had known the true way out of the class - unity and resistance. They had a conscious political consciousness and demanded the political rights they deserve. They wanted their own labor unions, not the capitalist unions. They asked the government and the police to treat them at least equally, rather than favoring the boss. When they raised these legitimate legal rights but were suppressed by the police authority, they dared to confront the violent machine positively and showed a fearless struggle spirit.

>首先，佳士斗争中涌现出来的青年工人们深知工人阶级的处境——处于社会最底层并且受尽压迫，也深知本阶级的真正出路——团结反抗。他们有了自觉的政治意识，要求应有的政治权利：要自己的工会，而不是老板的工会；要求政府和警察至少是平等对待，而不是偏袒老板的对待。当这些合理合法权利被黑警察镇压的时候，他们敢于正面反抗暴力机器，展现出了大无畏的斗争精神。

Secondly, the Jasic struggle is a great union of left-wing forces and a great union of social justice forces. New workers, left-wing students, old workers, veteran comrades, public welfare workers, labor activists, and all those who support workers' rights not only verbally but also in action were united in this struggle. Among the typical characters were: construction workers Yu Yuncong, Mi Jiuping, Liu Penghua, solidarity workers Li Zhan, Lan Zhiwei; left-wing students Gu Jiayue, Zhan Zhenzhen; old comrades Wu Jingtang, Ning Ding; public welfare people He Pengchao, Wang Xiangyi; labor activists Fu Changguo, Yang Zhengjun, and so on. Such a large-scale alliance is the first time in recent decades.

>其次，佳士斗争是一次左翼力量的大联合，是社会正义力量的大联合。新工人、左翼学生、老工人、老同志、公益人士、劳工维权人士，一切不仅在口头上而且在行动上支持工人权益的人们，都在这次斗争中联合起来了。其中的典型人物有：建会工人余浚聪、米久平、刘鹏华，声援工人李展、兰志伟；左翼学子顾佳悦、展振振；老同志吴敬堂、宁丁；公益人士贺鹏超、王相宜；劳工维权人士付常国、杨郑君，如此等等。这样大规模的联合，是近几十年来的首次。

Moreover, the Jasic struggle produced a group such as the Jasic Workers' Support Group, which is the concrete result of the left-wing unity. The Support Group adheres to the principle of “where is oppression, there is Support Group”. It is necessary not only to carry out the fight of the Jasic workers, but also to stand with all the oppressed and exploited people. The Support Group will solidarity with all the fight to against oppression and achieve the union of the oppressed masses.

>再次，佳士斗争产生了佳士工人声援团这样的团体，它是左翼联合的具体成果。声援团秉承着**“哪里有压迫，哪里就有声援团”**的原则，不仅要将佳士建会工人的斗争进行到底，更是要和一切被压迫、被剥削的群众站在一起，去声援一切反抗压迫的维权斗争，达成受压迫群众的团结和联合。

<br/>

The initial intentions and appeals of the Jasic Workers' Support Group are not complicated: as long as the comrades of the Jasic workers and the group members are not acquitted, as long as the struggle of the Jasic workers is still stigmatized by the evil forces, as long as the union by workers' own has not yet been established, and the Support Group will not stop fighting. More importantly, as long as there are still oppressed masses, the Jasic Workers' Support Group will not stop supporting and solidarity in their struggles. Because we know that the oppressed people throughout the world are one, and ultimately they must towards unity and fight together.

>佳士工人声援团的初心和诉求并不复杂：只要建会工人和声援团同志一天不被无罪释放，只要佳士工人的斗争依然被黑恶势力污名化，只要佳士工人自己说了算的工会还没有建立起来，声援团就不会停止斗争。更重要的是，只要仍有受压迫的群众在，佳士工人声援团就不会停止对他们斗争的支持和声援，因为全天下被压迫人民是一家，是最终要团结在一起，走到一起来的。

Based on the history of 2018 and before, looking forward to the future of 2019 and beyond, we can imagine that the suppression of the rights of workers, students and the masses by the evil forces will intensify. This is the result of the development of basic social contradictions. It has also been proved by the history of 2018. The growing union between the working class and all oppressed classes is equally inevitable. We will not surrender and be lost in the dream created by vested interests, but will unite and strive for our common realistic rights and dignity.

>基于2018年及以前的历史，展望2019年及以后的未来，我们可以想见：黑恶势力对工人、学子和群众权益的打压将会愈演愈烈，这既是社会基本矛盾发展的结果，也已由2018年的历史所证明。同样不可避免的是工人阶级和一切受压迫阶级越来越大的联合。我们不会臣服和迷失在既得利益者所营造的追梦幻想中，而是将团结起来，争取我们共同的、现实的权益和尊严。

In the new year, the Jasic Workers' Support Group will fight together with all the oppressed people to the end, and ready for the victory!

>新的一年里，佳士工人声援团将与一切受压迫群众一起，共同战斗到底！
